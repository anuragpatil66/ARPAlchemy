# ARPAlchemy - ARP Cache Poisoning Tool

**Note:** **As the code is specifically tailored for Linux OS, it can be used in only used in the systems running Linux OS and should be run using `ROOT Privileges` only**

**Note:** **Before using the code, run the command: `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` so that port forwarding is enabled and the poisoned system's requests are routed to the router through your system.**

Introducing the ARP Cache Poisoning Tool, a powerful utility for conducting ARP cache poisoning attacks to intercept network traffic. This tool provides a user-friendly interface and essential features for performing ARP cache poisoning attacks in a controlled environment.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

    1. ARP Cache Poisoning:
        - Poison the target's ARP cache with a custom ARP response packet.
        - Poison the router's ARP cache to redirect network traffic through the attacker.

    2. MAC Address and IP Validation:
        - Validate MAC addresses and IPv4/IPv6 addresses for accuracy and format.
   
    3. Variable Management:
        - Easily manage attacker MAC address, target IP and MAC, and router IP and MAC.
        - Clear all variables or view current values as needed.

    4. Interactive Menu:
        - Use an interactive menu to navigate through the tool's functionalities.
        - Start and stop ARP cache poisoning attacks with ease.

**Step-by-Step Usage Guide:**

    1. Set target IP and MAC addresses.
        - Set target IP and MAC addresses.
        - Start ARP cache poisoning attacks.
        - Monitor the ARP cache poisoning process.
        - Stop the ARP cache poisoning attack.

    2. MAC Address and IP Validation:
        - Enter your MAC address and validate its format.
        - Enter target IP and MAC addresses, and router IP and MAC addresses.
        - Ensure all addresses are correctly formatted.

    3. Variable Management:
        - Clear all variables when needed.
        - View the current values of attacker MAC, target IP and MAC, and router IP and MAC.

    4. Exit:
        - Exit the tool when you're done.
